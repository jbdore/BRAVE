# BRAVE
BRAVE is a collaborative research project started in January 2018, that aims at creating new physical-layer (PHY) techniques devoted to beyond-5G wireless communications. The partners (Siradel, Central-Sup√©lec, CEA-Leti and ANFR) are designing new high-data-rate and energy-efficient waveforms that operate in frequencies above 90 GHz. Application to scenarios such as kiosks, backhauling, hotspots are assessed to evaluate the benefit of the proposed technology. http://www.brave-beyond5g.com/
